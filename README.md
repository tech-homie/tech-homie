- 👋 Hi, I’m @tech-homie.  An unlikely and semi-accidental combination of hard core software nerd, rural mountain kid and homie.
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development including APIs, Javascript SPAs leveraging Angular & React, AWS, Azure, blockchain and Web 3 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, mongodb and the finer points of Nx Javascript monorepos 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding a new job LOL
- 📫 How to reach me.  manuel@techhomie.dev
